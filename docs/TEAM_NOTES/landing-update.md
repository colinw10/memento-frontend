Landing particles added to Home/Home.jsx

Summary

- I implemented animated particle effects in `src/pages/Home/Home.jsx` for the landing/hero area.
- I removed an old duplicate `src/pages/Home.jsx` that was left over from the refactor.

Why

- The project was refactored to a folder structure (`src/pages/Home/Home.jsx`). I added the particles to the new Home file so the landing experience loads on `/`.

Notes / Next steps


- Please confirm ownership: I updated the `docs/TEAM-README.md` to note that the landing particles were implemented by Pablo (🔴).

If you want me to extract the landing into a separate component, say the word and I'll do it.
